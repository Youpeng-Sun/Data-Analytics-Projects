# Data-Analytics-Projects

Project Overview
This project develops a Python-based optimisation model to solve a real-world logistics problem:

How can customer orders be allocated to delivery vehicles in a way that maximises loading capacity while maintaining balanced and similar order types across deliveries?

The model analyses:

Order weight

Order volume

Pallet specifications

Vehicle capacity constraints

It then applies an optimisation algorithm to generate an efficient loading plan that maximises vehicle utilisation while satisfying operational constraints.
